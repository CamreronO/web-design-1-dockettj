        <h2>Coffee Around the World</h2>
        <p>Coffee is a beloved beverage all around the world, and each country has its own unique coffee culture and traditions.

In Turkey, coffee is brewed in a special pot called a cezve, and it's served with a small sweet treat.</p>
        <p>One of the most interesting coffee traditions is in Ethiopia, where coffee is believed to have originated. In Ethiopia, coffee ceremonies are a cultural ritual that can last several hours and involve roasting the coffee beans, grinding them by hand, and brewing the coffee in a special pot called a jebena. The coffee is served in small cups and accompanied by snacks such as popcorn or roasted barley.</p>
